# PostgreSQL meetup

This meetup is most memorable to me for its originality. Lectures described the benefits of PostgreSQL, the functionality of the technology and information about the Russian-speaking community of the database.
The highlight of the program was the phrase "All you need is Postgres" written on the final slide of the last lecture.
After the event all participants were given small books about the basics of PostgreSQL, so [I had something to read](https://coolone.ru/books/postgres-for-beginners/) the next few days, but the highlight for me personally was a joint photo with [Bruce Momjian](https://momjian.us/) - co-founder of the "PostgreSQL Global Development Group" community.
