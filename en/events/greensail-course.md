# C++ development course

One of the key places where I learned how to program because that's where they taught me how to do what I wanted to do. It was the first time since [Pascal](https://coolone.ru/events/pascal-delphi-course/) that I encountered full-fledged, modern C++.
For me, "Green Sails" was the beginning of all subsequent achievements, primarily because of an experienced tutor who provided the conditions for professional growth, and because of the choice of technologies that I later mastered. 
Like me, many programmers around the world believe C++ is the best language to start learning how to program. In my case, I studied it for the first six months of training, and then I went on to Qt, which enhanced the possibilities and allowed for a graphical interface and more.
It was here that I developed my first more or less complete project and later [game](https://coolone.ru/projects/sword-battle/), which I had wanted to create for so long.
