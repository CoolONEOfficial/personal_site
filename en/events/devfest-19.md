# GDG DevFest Gorky 2019

This is the second DevFest I've been to. The event [like last year](https://coolone.ru/events/devfest-18/) lasted two days during which there were a lot of interesting lectures from local and foreign experts.
In between lectures it was interesting for me to walk around the stands of companies, each of which had quizzes, quests, drawings and other activities.

 After a full round, I picked up quite a few souvenirs - stickers, mugs, notepads, t-shirts, and more.
After the event there was a mass photo shoot and summing up the results of the raffles and contests. In general, I liked the event because for me it was quite interesting.
