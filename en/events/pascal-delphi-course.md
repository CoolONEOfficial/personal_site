# Delphi and Pascal development course

My first introduction to programming. At the time I wanted any way to learn how to make games and everything associated with them.
The first time it was difficult for me to study the programming device, but as soon as the training program came to the study of Delphi and the development of graphical interfaces my enthusiasm knew no bounds. I completed all tasks as quickly and accurately as possible, and when they ran out, I invented new ones and did them with the same success.
Since then that time of training has been a motivator for me to develop further, and I am glad that I started my professional life there.
