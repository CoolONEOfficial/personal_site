# IT Planet 2020/21 Final International Olympiad 

My second participation in this competition. Like in ["last time"](https://coolone.ru/ru/events/it-planet-18-19/) I chose the "Best Free Diploma" category, but this time my project was of a completely different type. If last time the topic of the project was a mobile app for scheduling, this time the topic was the development of chatbots.


At the Olympiad ["I told"](https://youtu.be/bvpScG3gJM0?t=5050) about ["Photobot"](https://coolone.ru/projects/photobot/) - a chatbot for photographers that automates the routine in their work. Fortunately I had enough time to mention the necessary details to appreciate my work.


As a result, my efforts were not in vain - ["in the final"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heqDvEmU368) the judges put my project in 1st place and I won the grand prize. This was a set of a medal, an Arduino-powered programmable robot, a book about gamesdev, and career advice from HH. Also in the package was all sorts of merch - mugs, notepads, and so on.


To sum up, I was satisfied with the level of this event and plan to continue participating in it in the future.
