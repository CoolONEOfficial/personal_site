# Github Graduation 2021

Online Graduation from Github? Sounds like a prank, but in reality it's a unique opportunity to make your name in history as a graduate on this site, listen to cozy live broadcast, and receive a gift for free. 🔥

In 2021 everyone who was active in open source, studied at an educational institution and was observant enough to fill in the application form in time was invited to this event. 👀

In my case I was lucky enough to be one of the first to register. This gave me the assurance that I would receive a unique card with information about me. To apply, I had to open a Pull Request in the event repository, and get my information into the ranks of other students. ✍️

At the event itself there was a live broadcast on Twich platform where two presenters discussed the news, communicated with the participants and congratulated all the graduates. I liked the technical side of the event without any complaints, as well as the atmosphere created by the presenters. 🎄

In the end, I liked this event even though it was not any complex technical lectures or challenges. In any case, I had a great time and got prizes to remember me by. 😁
