# HanabiHack

This hackathon was one of the most memorable of all because it was very atmospheric - everyone was given foreign food, at night you could watch movies, there were board games on the site, and much more. On the morning of the second day, the organizers brought everyone sushi.

 After the awards ceremony, all the participants discussed the results for a long time and gave interviews to the organizers. I, like everyone else, enjoyed the event.
