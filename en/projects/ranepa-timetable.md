# RANEPA (Schedule) app

Schedule of classes for the students of Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration. In it I have implemented all the wishes of my classmates - there is a native widget, support for caching, color profiles, integration with Google Calendar and alarm clock. 

From start to finish this project took about four months.

After the project was published, it was used by a large number of students and teachers of RANEPA.

I also had some help with the design and uploading to the App Store from my classmates, whose names are listed in the app. After the end of the development in a few months the repository of the application began to be evaluated by the open source community.
 
Also this project was sent to the project competition at the international Olympiad "IT-Planet 2018/2019" and [took the 2nd place](https://coolone.ru/achievements/it-planet-18-19/) there in the "Free Diploma" direction. üéâüòÅ
