# Vkontakter

This is a framework for developing chatbots on the VKontakte social network platform. Work on it began because of the need to develop a chatbot for the chosen platform, and the lack of ready-made libraries for Swift.

With its help it is possible to: â€¨
- Send and receive messages, media, commands.
- Track button presses, send them as a keyboard.
- Get information about social network users.

To add new functions in the future, just use the built-in API parser.
