# Travel Quest

This tourist app is a graduation project of the Samsung IT School. In it I used Firestore, Google Maps and Firebase Auth for the first time. The functionality of the application allows you to view descriptions of attractions around the world and add your own.
The structure of the descriptions of attractions is arranged in such a way that it is possible to divide the text into subheadings, as well as to link to other attractions.

1. { }
2. ![ ](2_400x400.jpg)
3. ![ ](1_400x400.jpg)
4. ![ ](3_400x400.jpg)

 Also, all input data are localized using the Google Translate API. 
Among the projects of Samsung IT School graduates, this project [took 1st place](https://coolone.ru/achievements/samsung-it-school/) in the "Social Applications" direction.
