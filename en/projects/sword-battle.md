# Sword Battle

My first game in C++. During its development I wanted to make it as beautiful and qualitative as possible, but at that moment I didn't have enough experience and knowledge to develop a really big project, and I was too young.

It was the first time I encountered so many difficulties associated with the implementation of game mechanics.

For the development of this project, as well as previous ones, I used Qt - one of the most appropriate C++ frameworks. 

All the graphics in the game were drawn by hand, and the fonts and music were taken from public sources.
