# Personal portfolio site (v2)

Second version of personal website with projects, achievements and much more. This site was written on [Nuxt.js](https://ru.nuxtjs.org) - one of the major frameworks supporting actual technologies.

On this site you can learn about all my projects, accomplishments, see events I've been to, listen to music I'm listening to in real time. In addition to the above, it is possible to switch between dark and light design and much more.

Of the supported technologies framework provides support for SSR, PWA, SEO optimization using JSON-LD and Open Graph Protocol.
All site data is stored in Firestore - a free NoSQL database from Google.

I wrote a separate [mobile app on Flutter] (https://github.com/CoolONEOfficial/personal_site_app) to manage all the data.

All the design was done using Buefy - CSS adaptation of Bulma framework for Vue.js.

It took me about three weeks to develop this site, not counting the app development.
