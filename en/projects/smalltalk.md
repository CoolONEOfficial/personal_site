# SmallTalk

A fast and convenient messenger for iOS inspired by Telegram. The app was developed as a final project in [EPAM's iOS development course](/events/ios-course). A team of four students, including myself, were involved in the development.

The application has a wide range of functionality: you can create and edit chats, save messages, forward messages, edit your profile and the profiles of your contacts, and much more. 

Also messages can consist of a combination of content, for example, you can send several images with text, or a voice message, or a picture without text, as it is implemented in other messengers.

The application automatically imports your contacts who are registered in SmallTalk during registration, which allows your friends and acquaintances to see that you have joined their ranks and can start a dialogue with you.
