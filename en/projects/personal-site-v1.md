# Personal portfolio site (v1)

The first attempt to create a personal portfolio site based on the most common CMS - [Wordpress](https://ru.wordpress.org). On it I posted my first projects and videos of their work. ðŸ‘¶

This site lasted until my [immersion in web development](/achievements/foxford/). Later, when I got the opportunity to write the site myself from scratch, I wrote [the next version of my site](/projects/personal-site-v2/).
