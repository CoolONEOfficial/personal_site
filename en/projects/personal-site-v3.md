# Personal Portfolio Site (v3)

The third version of this site, written using Swift and the [Publish library](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish) for generating static sites.

During its development I moved all the content from Firestore to markdown files, rewrote the design to be easier to maintain, and finally made the site static. This improved loading speed, but I had to cut some functionality of the site.
