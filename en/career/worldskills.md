# Worldskills Russia

Since the end of 2020 I have been included in the national Worldskills team for the competence "Mobile Application Development". ðŸ¥³

This event was covered in a number of Nizhny Novgorod publications, as well as in Rossiyskaya Gazeta. In addition, Samsung Russia and EPAM groups released publications on this occasion in social networks. 

In the nearest future our team is preparing to participate in the world championship on mobile application development to be held in Shanghai in 2022.
