# Swift. Fundamentals of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS app development

A good book for an introduction to the Swift programming language that I read in preparation for an iOS development course.
This book is written in the most interesting, concise, and to the point way possible. It is worth noting that the author has tried to motivate the reader while learning the material, especially seen in the introduction and conclusion of the book.
Overall I really enjoyed this book, I learned the basics of Swift and got to know the world of software development for Apple devices.
