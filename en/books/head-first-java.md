# Learning Java (Head First Java)

I read this book to prepare for Samsung IT School, which helped me in the future when developing ["Travel Quest"](https://coolone.ru/projects/travel-quest/). In it you can find all the basic knowledge about Java - history of the language, versions, development path and more.
After reading this book it was noticeably easier for me to learn native Android development and to develop my own projects using Java. Each of the chapters clearly and understandably explains the different features of this programming language.
Overall, I liked the book, especially I remember the funny examples and illustrations.
