# Perfect Code

The book deals with the basics of software design and development and is widely known in the professional community around the world.
Although at the time when I started selectively reading this book I was not experienced enough and many of the terms were unfamiliar to me, in time I began to understand the material I read and was more than satisfied with the result.
