# Winning the Volvo Cars Digital Challenge 

My first victory in the online hackathon as a member of Team13. ðŸ¥³ This time we have chosen Volvo's all-Russian hackathon for participation. There were two tracks to choose from: the mobile application of the loyalty program and the development of the customer engagement services. Since we had more experience with mobile apps, we chose the first track.

This time I was only responsible for the technical implementation of the mobile application, so I could choose any technology to develop it. And I chose SwiftUI. This framework suited perfectly for the hackathon - coupled with my MacBook on the m1 I was able to quickly develop a full-fledged (by the standards of hackathons) mobile application right on my knees.
