# Winning the ETHGlobal London 2024 

After a month or so of living in England, I was suddenly invited to participate in the ETHGlobal London hackathon on blockchain and cryptocurrencies 🤑


🧠 700 Hackers
✈️ 61 Countries
👾 241 Projects
🏆 10 Finalists


Since my main activity is iOS development I implemented a mobile app on SwiftUI using a pre-trained ML model, as well as integration with blockchain and a separate backend. At this hackathon, we emphasised on an unusual bundle of technology and idea, though UI also helped us win our awards.
