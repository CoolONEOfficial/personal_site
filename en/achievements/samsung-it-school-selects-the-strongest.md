# Winning the "IT School Selects the Strongest" project competition

After finishing the [Samsung IT School](https://coolone.ru/events/samsung-it-school/) program, all the students submitted their final projects to the competition. In my case it was [Travel Quest](https://coolone.ru/projects/travel-quest/) - a mobile application for tourists, which as a result was the best in its category.
Unfortunately I was not able to attend the awards ceremony due to the fact that I was out of town, so I can not assess the awards ceremony.
This diploma came with [Samsung IT School certificate](https://coolone.ru/achievements/samsung-it-school/).
