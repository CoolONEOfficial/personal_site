# 1 place in the finals of the International Olympiad "IT Planet 2020/21".


At the Olympiad ["I told"](https://youtu.be/bvpScG3gJM0?t=5050) about ["Fotobot"](https://coolone.ru/projects/photobot/), a chatbot for photographers that automates the routine in their work. Fortunately I had enough time to mention the necessary details to appreciate my work.


As a result, my efforts were not in vain - ["in the final"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heqDvEmU368) the judges put my project in 1st place and I won the grand prize. This was a set of a medal, an Arduino-powered programmable robot, a book about gamesdev, and career advice from HH. Also in the package was all sorts of merch - mugs, notepads, and so on.


The prize came to me a few months after the finals.
